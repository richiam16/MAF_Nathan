# Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transmission Survival Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis related to the manuscript titled:  
**"Genes required by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive transmission"** by Mishra et al.

The code here is relevant to two main analyses:
1. **Transmission Survival Genome of Mtb**: This section includes the analysis of pooled CRISPRi library results, generating the number of significant differences (NOSDs) counts for each stage of transmission.
2. **Proteome Analysis**: This section analyzes the hydrophilicity index, glycine content, and the fraction of residues classified as intrinsically disordered regions across the Mtb proteome, exploring their relationship with essentiality counts.
