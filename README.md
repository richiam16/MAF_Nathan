## Overview
This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks related to the manuscript titled:
**"Genes required by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive transmission"** by Mishra et al.

The notebooks cover two analyses:
1. **Transmission Survival Genome of Mtb**: Pooled CRISPRi library results, generating number of significant differences (NOSD) counts.
2. **Proteome Analysis**: Hydrophilicity index, glycine content, and intrinsic disorder regions analysis across the Mtb proteome.

## How to Use
To run the notebooks:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/richiam16/MAF_Nathan.git

2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Follow the documented steps in each notebook to reproduce the analyses.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Libraries (install via `pip`):
   pip install pandas tqdm numpy matplotlib seaborn umap-learn hvplot holoviews bokeh biopython

## Notebooks Overview
- `notebook_1.ipynb`: Transmission survival genome analysis (CRISPRi results).
- `notebook_2.ipynb`: Analysis of hydrophilicity index and glycine content.
